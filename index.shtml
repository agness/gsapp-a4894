				As emerging technologies such as VR/AR dissolve prior divides between the digital and physical experience, how can we draw upon interdisciplinary methods to design for the future mixed reality that is just around the corner? Through readings, discussions, and hands‐on projects, this course will examine principles of human‐computer interaction alongside qualitative and quantitative methods in architectural research. We will survey current technology trends and examine their implications for design and for society. Students will develop skills in user research, rapid‐prototyping, usability testing, and data collection as methods for excellent interaction and spatial design.

		<h5>Course Objectives</h5>
		Students will...
		<ul id="learning-goals">
			<li>Add user-centered design methods to their repertoire of design skills, and understand the strengths and limitations of these methods and how they can be applied to the student’s own field of work.</li>
			<li>Learn to use a variety of rapid prototyping tactics and tools (analog and digital) to prototype mixed reality experiences.</li>
			<li>Understand technical concepts underlying mixed reality technologies, current state-of-the-art, and future challenges.</li>
			<li>Gain familiarity with the unique interaction design needs of mixed reality experiences based on human physiology and psychology (e.g. ergonomics, sensory conflicts, gestural semantics.)</li>
			<li>Develop a critical perspective on current and future trends in mixed reality design and their implications on society.
