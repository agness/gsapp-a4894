          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>As emerging technologies such as VR/AR dissolve prior divides between the digital and physical experience, how can we draw upon interdisciplinary methods to design for the future mixed reality that is just around the corner? Through readings, discussions, and hands‐on projects, this course will examine principles of human‐computer interaction alongside qualitative and quantitative methods in architectural research. We will survey current technology trends and examine their implications for design and for society. Students will develop skills in user research, rapid‐prototyping, usability testing, and data collection as methods for excellent interaction and spatial design.</p>

          <p>Weekly assignments will build toward a final project in which students will research, design, prototype and evaluate a mobile application or augmented reality prototype of a hybrid physical-digital experience, in a self‐chosen site in the city.</p>

          <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Add user-centered design methods to their repertoire of design skills, and understand the strengths and limitations of these methods and how they can be applied to the student’s own field of work.</li>
            <li>Learn to use a variety of rapid prototyping tactics and tools (analog and digital) to prototype mixed reality experiences.</li>
            <li>Understand technical concepts underlying mixed reality technologies, current state-of-the-art, and future challenges.</li>
            <li>Gain familiarity with the unique interaction design needs of mixed reality experiences based on human physiology and psychology (e.g. ergonomics, sensory conflicts, gestural semantics.)</li>
            <li>Develop a critical perspective on current and future trends in mixed reality design and their implications on society.

          <h3>Caveat Emptor</h3>
          Reasons you might plausibly want to take or drop this class:
          <ul>
            <li>This class is about “learning by doing”: we will read a lot and we will discuss a lot, but it’s mostly about doing and about building things for people to use.</li>
            <li>We will talk about code in this class; however, you won’t come out with an iOS app at the end of the semester (unless you really want to.) That said, you can probably eke by without writing more than 20 lines of code.</li>
            <li>Your assignments will involve interviewing and showing your work to people on the street, this might be scary.</li>
            <li>This class is experimental: mixed reality is an emerging field and I’ll be learning from you as much as you will be learning from each other and myself. By the way, I’m not an architect. I’m very excited for us, as a class, to discover new intersections between architecture and software design as it applies to our future society, and I hope you are excited as well.</li>
